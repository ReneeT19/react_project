# React Project
## Problem Statement
Create a website for a fictional company that sells some sort of products. On this website, a user will be able to browse through products and be able to place items into their shopping cart and purchase them. In order to keep track of the products added to the shopping cart, you can use states or session storage. Make sure to use React Router and split up your project into as many components as you see fit.

## Requirements:
- Use React Router
- A component for the header and footer that will be displayed for each page
- A navbar fixed at the top or side of the page that you can use to navigate through the pages
- Pages for the website:
1. Landing page
- The home page that introduces the company
- Include one picture here that you pull from a public API (can be anything) using AXIOS
- Feel free to get creative with how this will look!
2. Product Page
- Lists all the products available for purchase on the site
- Each product should at least have a description, image, and price
- There should be some sort of button next to each product that will add them to your cart
- A button that allows you to “Checkout” and purchase all the products in your cart
3. Cart (Can also just be part of the Product Page)
- Once you’ve clicked to purchase your items, redirect here
- Display the items to purchase, their price, and the total cost for everything
- Once a user clicks to purchase the items, show some sort of confirmation with a summary of their order

## Extensions:
- On the landing page, add a banner that that cycles through images
- Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) Page
○ Have a series of questions listed on the page, when you hover over the question, the words become a slightly bigger font and bold
○ When the question is clicked, the answer is displayed just below it, can click it again to hide the answer
- About Us Page
○ Have a series of images with a text box displayed just below
○ When you hover over the image, new text should display in the text box
○ When you stop hovering over the image, the original text should be displayed again
- On the Products Page
○ Add a search bar to filter through the products
○ Add other search feature to filter by a minimum or maximum price range
- Have a way to delete/remove items from your cart
- Add a login, once a user is logged in, their username will be displayed at the top of the page to show they are currently logged in
- Use a public API to populate some of the information for the products on your site
